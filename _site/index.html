    I wanted to dig into some new (to me) front end web technologies and tools so I made a thing. Have you ever happened across a new library or an interesting blog post and wanted to know what other people think? I seem to do this all the time and finding discussions about a random website isn&#8217;t always as quick as I&#8217;d like. I wanted something that would search both Hacker News and Reddit for me and give me links to the latest discussions about whatever it is I&#8217;m reading. Now I have it.

    There are many posts around the web about how to run Emacs in Windows. While many of these suggest building and running a native version of Emacs, many others suggest running the version available through Cygwin. I tried both approaches many times but always ran into problems with the packages that I use most often. On top of that I was plagued with slowness that just isn&#8217;t there on other platforms. The good news is I&#8217;ve found a happy medium that works quite well for me and this post documents that monster I&#8217;ve created. What I wanted My goals for...

    After a couple of months of using emacs as my primary editor I&#8217;ve finally settled down. I am as comfortable now with emacs as I was with vim when I made the switch. With that in mind, I feel like I need to explain why I&#8217;m sticking with it. Hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to convey this in a way that a vim power user might appreciate. I understand now that comparing vim and emacs is ridiculous. Vim is an editor. Emacs is a host for running elisp applications. When I was a vim user I thought it was nonsense that...

    If you&#8217;re reading this that means the site&#8217;s transition to Jekyll is complete. Over the past couple of days I&#8217;ve been working on migrating my old flask+flatpages implementation over to Jekyll and I will now be hosting everything on GitHub. Everything is pretty much the same with a few minor visual changes.

Comment threads will be broken until I get the time to remap them with Disqus but eventually I&#8217;ll have all four comments back to their respective articles.

As always, please let me know if you notice any residual issues.

    I&#8217;d like to think I&#8217;m not one to be pedantic about things, but there&#8217;s one common misconception that has been making the rounds that annoys me to no end. Ctrl-c is not equivalent to Escape. There are two key differences that can be demonstrated by the following two snippets. Ctrl-c skips any pending insert mode abbreviations. In a vim session type the following: :iabbrev teh the This is a common misspelling and an oft used abbreviation. Now enter insert mode and type teh&lt;Space&gt;. Notice that the space completed the abbreviation and it now says the instead of teh. Now do...
