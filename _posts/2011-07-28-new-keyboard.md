title: My "New" Keyboard

Lately I've been doing more programming at home on the iMac and I've been having
some very noticeable wrist pains as a result of using that tiny keyboard.  Since
I use a [fully split keyboard][0] at work I figured I'd go ahead and find
another one I could use at home.  After a bit of research I ended up grabbing
another Kinesis off eBay.  I would say it's a Kinesis classic, however there is
no branding on it whatsoever.  My guess is that it was their original model.

Almost everyone who has seen it thus far thinks I'm crazy, here are some
pictures so you can see why:

I must say I'm quite happy with it so far.  I'm having a lot of trouble with the
curly-braces/square-brackets and the backspace keys.  I've always hit the
spacebar with my left thumb so now I'm gettinloosentencethaloolikthis.  Once
that muscle memory is gone I think I'll be fine.  I already feel almost up to
speed when typing normal text but programming is significantly more difficult at
this point.

Overall I think this was a good purchase.  Maybe later this year
I'll buy one of the more modern (and much more expensive) models.

Oh, and for those who may be interested, here's the label:
