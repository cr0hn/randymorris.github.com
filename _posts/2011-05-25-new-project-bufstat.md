I recently wrote a vim plugin called bufstat that keeps a list of open
buffers in your statusline.  It offers a variety of options for
customizing the display of the buffer list as well as a few different
ways to sort the list.  You can even provide your own sorting function
if you feel so inclined.  This is how bufstat looks in my configuration:

So far I've had a few users give me some positive feedback but I could
always use feedback of any kind.  If you'd like to try it out it's
hosted on [github](http://github.com/) as
[vim-bufstat](http://github.com/rson/vim-bufstat/).  Install it like you
would any other plugin.

The documentation should be accurate and up to date but if there are any
questions please let me know.  You'll probably want to read at least the
intro and usage sections of the doc so you'll know what to expect.
