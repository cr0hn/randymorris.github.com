Often times I find myself editing a file and I suddenly realize I need
to look up some data from some other file.  Until today, I would
normally do something along the lines of the following:

 * `:sp path/to/file`
 * `<C-w><C-w>`

I continue editing my original file.  When I find  I no longer need the
reference file, I need to switch to it and kill its window:

 * `<C-w><C-w>`
 * `:q`

There is a better way. `pedit path/to/file` (or `:ped` if you're lazy
like me) will open a split window just as before, but cuts out the
middle commands.  Focus stays on the file I was working on with my
cursor unmoved.  The same scenario with `:pedit` is: 

 * `:ped /path/to/file`
 * (continue editing my buffer)
 * `:pc`

Four steps cut to two.  This is why I use vim.
