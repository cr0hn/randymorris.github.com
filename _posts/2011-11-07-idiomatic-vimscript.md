title: "Idiomatic vimscript"

For those who may be interested, I've created a repo on GitHub where I
plan to dump small functions and scripts I write while helping people on
irc or on Stack Overflow.  In these scripts I will try my hardest to use
"best practices" so they can be used as examples when writing your own
scripts.

Please let me know if you notice anything you would do differently.  The
point of this is to serve as digestable examples of proper vimscript.

Check it out at [vimscript-snippets][1].
