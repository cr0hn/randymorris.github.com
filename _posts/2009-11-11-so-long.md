I may not be the most active member of the Arch community but with
almost 1100 posts on the bbs and well over two years being active in
\#archlinux, I'd like to think I've done my part.  Recently I realized
that I've grown tired of reading and answering the same questions over
and over again.  Quite honestly, I'm not sure how the Arch devs and
active supporters don't just crack and disappear more often than they
do.  

In the three years I've used Arch many things have changed -- especially
the community.  The increasing popularity has attracted many users who
simply are not prepared to use what Arch gives them.  I'm tired of
holding their hands.  I'm tired of watching other people hold their
hands.  I've been slain by the [help vampire][0].

Consider this a resignation as an active Arch community member.  Not
goodbye, more like "keep in touch".  I'll still be around on the bbs
and I'm sure I'll be stopping in on irc every now and again, but much
less often.  Feel free to shoot me an email.  I'll be keeping tabs on
your websites too, so keep those updates coming.
