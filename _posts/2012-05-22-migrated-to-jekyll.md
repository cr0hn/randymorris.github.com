If you're reading this that means the site's transition to Jekyll is complete.  Over the past couple of days I've been working on migrating my old [flask][0]+[flatpages][1] implementation over to [Jekyll][2] and I will now be hosting everything on GitHub.  Everything is pretty much the same with a few minor visual changes.

Comment threads will be broken until I get the time to remap them with Disqus but eventually I'll have all four comments back to their respective articles.

As always, please let me know if you notice any residual issues.
