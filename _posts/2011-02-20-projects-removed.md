I have removed both slurpy and shop from my website as I have abandoned
both projects.  You can still find forks of either one on github,
however I recommend using the alternatives listed below instead.

Slurpy
: - Fork on github: [slurpy][1]
  - Alternative: [cower][2] (written in C, same ideals as slurpy)

Shop
:  - Fork on github: [shop][3]
   - Alternative: [permpath][4] (a more elegant solution)

Thanks for using my projects, hopefully you'll find the alternative
solutions better (as I did).
