      <h1><a href="/2012/07/18/why-emacs.html">Why Emacs?</a></h1>
    </header>
    <p>After a couple of months of using emacs as my primary editor I&#8217;ve finally settled down. I am as comfortable now with emacs as I was with vim when I made the switch. With that in mind, I feel like I need to explain why I&#8217;m sticking with it. Hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to convey this in a way that a vim power user might appreciate.</p>

<p>I understand now that comparing vim and emacs is ridiculous. Vim is an editor. Emacs is a host for running elisp applications.</p>

<p>When I was a vim user I thought it was nonsense that so many emacs users claimed that they hardly ever left emacs. Now it&#8217;s perfectly clear to me why they&#8217;d make such a claim. When you start using applications within emacs (such as an irc client, news reader, or calendar) you suddenly have a single, unified set of keybinds across all of your tools. Switching between chat windows and switching between text files use the exact same mechanism. Even switching between applications works the same way. Chances are you will probably be editing some text in those applications. Since you&#8217;re already inside emacs you get a familiar set of editing bindings &#8211;including your personal configuration&#8211; for free, in every application. This is something I&#8217;ve fought for years to achieve.</p>

<p>Another reason I consider emacs to be more of an environment is that it was designed from the ground up to be extended. Emacs provides hooks (similar to autocmd events in vimscript) for almost anything you can think of. These allow you to run arbitrary elisp when specific events happen. On top of that, elisp allows you to modify literally any function to add functionality without having to rewrite the entire function. This is called &#8220;advising&#8221; the function. The power that this gives you is really hard to convey because there isn&#8217;t any concept of this in vim.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not an advocate of pushing people into making the switch to emacs. That being said, <a href='https://twitter.com/magnars'>Magnar Sveen</a> summed up my thoughts pretty well in one of his talks on <a href='http://emacsrocks.com'>Emacs Rocks</a>:</p>

    </header>
    <p>If you&#8217;re reading this that means the site&#8217;s transition to Jekyll is complete. Over the past couple of days I&#8217;ve been working on migrating my old <a href='http://flask.pocoo.org/'>flask</a>+<a href='http://packages.python.org/Flask-FlatPages/'>flatpages</a> implementation over to <a href='http://jekyllrb.com'>Jekyll</a> and I will now be hosting everything on GitHub. Everything is pretty much the same with a few minor visual changes.</p>

<p>Comment threads will be broken until I get the time to remap them with Disqus but eventually I&#8217;ll have all four comments back to their respective articles.</p>

<p>As always, please let me know if you notice any residual issues.</p>

      <h1><a href="/2012/05/13/ctrl-c-is-not-escape.html">Ctrl-C is not Escape</a></h1>
    </header>
    <p>I&#8217;d like to think I&#8217;m not one to be pedantic about things, but there&#8217;s one common misconception that has been making the rounds that annoys me to no end. <em>Ctrl-c</em> is not equivalent to <em>Escape</em>. There are two key differences that can be demonstrated by the following two snippets.</p>

<p><em>Ctrl-c skips any pending insert mode abbreviations.</em></p>

<p>In a vim session type the following:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='vim'><span class='p'>:</span><span class='k'>iabbrev</span> teh <span class='k'>the</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This is a common misspelling and an oft used abbreviation. Now enter insert mode and type <code>teh&lt;Space&gt;</code>. Notice that the space completed the abbreviation and it now says <code>the</code> instead of <code>teh</code>. Now do the same but instead insert <code>teh&lt;Esc&gt;</code>. The abbreviation still happens. Do the same with <code>teh&lt;Ctrl-c&gt;</code>. The abbreviation is not completed.</p>

<p><em>Ctrl-c does not fire the InsertLeave autocmd event.</em></p>

<p>Dump the following snipped into &#8220;cursorline.vim&#8221; and launch vim with &#8220;vim -u cursorline.vim&#8221;.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='vim'>augroup CursorLine     
    autocmd<span class='p'>!</span>
    autocmd <span class='nb'>InsertEnter</span> * <span class='k'>set</span> <span class='nb'>nocursorline</span>
    autocmd <span class='nb'>InsertLeave</span> * <span class='k'>set</span> <span class='nb'>cursorline</span>
augroup END
<span class='k'>set</span> <span class='nb'>cursorline</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This snippet enables &#8216;cursorline&#8217; while in normal mode and disables it in insert mode. If you go into insert mode and exit with <em>Esc</em> you&#8217;ll notice that the cursorline is re-enabled, however, if you enter insert mode and exit with <em>Ctrl-c</em> you&#8217;ll see that it is never re-enabled.</p>

<p>These two things probably don&#8217;t seem that important to you, but what about the developers of the plugins you use? If you&#8217;re using a plugin that relies on either of these two features you&#8217;re risking some functionality breaking by using <em>Ctrl-c</em>. If you must use something other than <em>Escape</em>, use <em>Ctrl-[</em> instead as these <i>are</i> equivalent.</p>
