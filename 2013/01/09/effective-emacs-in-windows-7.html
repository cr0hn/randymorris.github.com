      <h1><a href="">Effective Emacs in Windows 7</a></h1>
    </header>
    <p>There are many posts around the web about how to run Emacs in Windows. While many of these suggest building and running a native version of Emacs, many others suggest running the version available through <a href='http://www.cygwin.com/'>Cygwin</a>. I tried both approaches many times but always ran into problems with the packages that I use most often. On top of that I was plagued with slowness that just isn&#8217;t there on other platforms. The good news is I&#8217;ve found a happy medium that works quite well for me and this post documents that monster I&#8217;ve created.</p>

<h2 id='what_i_wanted'>What I wanted</h2>

<p>My goals for this setup were to make Emacs run on a &#8220;remote&#8221; machine and display on my local Windows install. I also wanted this to be as seamless as possible so that it felt as if I was running a native application. To do this I needed quite a bit of supporting software.</p>

<h2 id='an_emacs_host'>An Emacs host</h2>

<p>I used a Linux host, specifically a VirtualBox VM running a minimal Ubuntu server install. Your host is going to need to have an opensshd and X11 installed, with X11 forwarding enabled in <code>sshd_config</code>. Anyone reading this guide is probably already very familiar with these steps so I&#8217;ll leave out the details.</p>

<p>I wrote a couple of scripts help make running a VM more bearable. This is VirtualBox specific, but I&#8217;m sure it can be adapted to other virtualization solutions.</p>

<p>file: <code>EmacsHost.bat</code> <div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bat'><span class='p'>@</span><span class='k'>echo</span> <span class='k'>off</span>
<span class='s2'>&quot;C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxHeadless.exe&quot;</span> -s EmacsHost
</code></pre>
</div></p>

<p>This batch file launches the VM named &#8220;EmacsHost&#8221; in headless mode. This means the only access to the machine is through remote services like ssh or vnc. Unfortunately, because it&#8217;s batch, this leaves a command prompt hanging around. To get rid of that I used a bit of VBScript.</p>

<p>file: <code>EmacsHost.vbs</code> <div class='highlight'><pre><code class='vbnet'><span class='k'>Set</span> <span class='n'>WshShell</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='n'>WScript</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='n'>CreateObject</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='s'>&quot;WScript.Shell&quot;</span><span class='p'>)</span>
<span class='n'>obj</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='n'>WshShell</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='n'>Run</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='s'>&quot;c:\path\to\EmacsHost.bat&quot;</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='mi'>0</span><span class='p'>)</span>
<span class='k'>set</span> <span class='n'>WshShell</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='k'>Nothing</span>
</code></pre>
</div></p>

<p>Running <code>Emacs.vbs</code> runs <code>EmacsHost.bat</code> in a subprocess and kills off the parent shell.</p>

<p>I finished off the VM setup by having <code>EmacsHost.vbs</code> run on boot so it is always running whenever I attempt to run Emacs. The VM is tiny so it starts up immediately and I don&#8217;t worry about powering it off as there isn&#8217;t much to lose on the machine itself.</p>

<h2 id='putty_and_friends'>PuTTY and friends</h2>

<p>The <a href='http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html'>PuTTY</a> project is a set of Windows applications that allow you to connect to remote machines via a number of protocols. You can download the two specific applications you&#8217;ll need directly but I strongly suggest downloading the installer for simplicity&#8217;s sake. From this project I used <code>PuTTYgen</code> to set up the ssh certificates and <code>plink</code> to make the connection to launch Emacs.</p>

<p>Unfortunately PuTTY&#8217;s certificates are incompatible with openssh and there is some work that needs to be done to make a private/public key pair that will work between the machines. There are many resources on setting up these certificates so I won&#8217;t go into details here. Later I reference the private key on Windows as &#8220;EmacsHostKey.ppk&#8221;.</p>

<h2 id='an_x11_server'>An X11 server</h2>

<p>In order to have Emacs display on your Windows machine you will need to be running an X11 server. I chose <a href='http://x.cygwin.com/'>Cygwin/X</a> since I had Cygwin installed for other reasons already. I also chose to launch the X server on startup at the same time as my VM, for the same reasons.</p>

<h2 id='putting_it_all_together'>Putting it all together</h2>

<p>To wrap things up I wrote a couple of scripts to make launching Emacs convenient.</p>

<p>file: <code>Emacs.bat</code> <div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bat'><span class='p'>@</span><span class='k'>echo</span> <span class='k'>off</span>
plink -l user -X -i c:\path\to\EmacsHostKey.ppk localhost <span class='s2'>&quot;emacsclient -c -a &#39;&#39;&quot;</span>
</code></pre>
</div></p>

<p>file: <code>Emacs.vbs</code> <div class='highlight'><pre><code class='vbnet'><span class='k'>Set</span> <span class='n'>WshShell</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='n'>WScript</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='n'>CreateObject</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='s'>&quot;WScript.Shell&quot;</span><span class='p'>)</span>
<span class='n'>obj</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='n'>WshShell</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='n'>Run</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='s'>&quot;c:\path\to\Emacs.bat&quot;</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='mi'>0</span><span class='p'>)</span>
<span class='k'>set</span> <span class='n'>WshShell</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='k'>Nothing</span>
</code></pre>
</div></p>

<p>With a running X server and a running VM, double clicking on <code>Emacs.vbs</code> in an Explorer window will launch emacsclient on the VM and display it on the Windows machine..</p>

<h2 id='whats_left'>What&#8217;s left?</h2>

<p>One slight annoyance is that pinning Emacs to the taskbar doesn&#8217;t work as expected. With Cygwin/X, pinning it actually pins an Xwin instance to the taskbar and clicking this doesn&#8217;t launch Emacs. To fix this I found an odd workaround somewhere on the <a href='http://emacswiki.org/'>Emacs Wiki</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Right click on the pinned XWin icon on the taskbar.</li>

<li>Right click on the Xwin entry at the top of the popup menu.</li>

<li>Select properties option.</li>

<li>Modify the &#8220;Target&#8221; field to point to <code>Emacs.vbs</code>.</li>

<li>Optional: Select the &#8220;Change Icon&#8221; button and select an Emacs icon file.</li>

<li>Optional: Select the &#8220;General&#8221; tab.</li>

<li>Optional: Modify the first field to be &#8220;Emacs&#8221; instead of &#8220;Xwin&#8221;.</li>
</ol>

<p>After a reboot (or restart of explorer.exe) the pinned Emacs icon functions just as any other pinned application.</p>

<h2 id='the_result'>The result</h2>

<p>After following these steps I&#8217;m left with is an Emacs that behaves as though it is a native Windows application without the slowness or incompatibilities I ran into with a native Emacs build.</p>

<h2 id='notes'>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>I haven&#8217;t done anything new here. This is the result of smashing ideas together that I found through months of searching for solutions for my frustrations. I intend on attempting to credit peices of this as I have time to try to find the original sources. I would be very surprised if all of this information can&#8217;t be found on <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/'>StackOverflow</a> or <a href='http://emacswiki.org/'>the wiki</a></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>I chose to run Emacs in daemon/client mode but that&#8217;s totally optional. Just change &#8220;emacsclient&#8221; to &#8220;emacs&#8221; if you don&#8217;t want this behavior.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You don&#8217;t really need to run a VM if you have access to a unix host. Theoretically, running a VM greatly reduces network lag and makes Emacs feel much more snappy but I have yet to try a true host in practice.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>I actually have taken this a step further and set up a folder that is shared between EmacsHost and my Windows installation. This allows me to access my files from other applications in Windows if need be. I&#8217;ll leave this as an exercise for the reader.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any questions or suggestions on how I could improve either this setup or the guide itself speak up.</p>
